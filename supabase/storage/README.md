# Storage Configuration

This document outlines the Supabase Storage setup for file handling.

## üîç How to Extract Storage Information

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    public,
    file_size_limit,
    allowed_mime_types,
    created_at
FROM
    storage.buckets;
```

## üîê Storage Security

### RLS Policies Needed

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Storage buckets need RLS policies for secure access:

```sql
-- Example policies that should be implemented:

-- Resumes: Users can upload their own, admins can view all
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'resumes' AND auth.uid()::text = owner);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'resumes' AND auth.uid()::text = owner);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'resumes' AND is_admin_check());

-- Avatars: Users manage their own, public viewing
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = owner);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

## üíæ Storage Best Practices

### ‚úÖ **Current Setup Strengths**

1. **Appropriate File Types** - PDF/DOCX for resumes, JPEG/PNG for avatars
2. **Size Limits** - 2MB limit on avatars prevents large uploads
3. **Public Access** - Enables direct URL usage in applications
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Different buckets for different purposes

### üöÄ **Enhancement Suggestions**

1. **Add Resume Size Limit** - Consider 10MB limit for resumes
2. **Implement Storage RLS** - Add security policies as shown above
3. **Add File Cleanup** - Auto-delete orphaned files when applications/profiles are removed
4. **Virus Scanning** - Consider adding file scanning for uploaded documents
